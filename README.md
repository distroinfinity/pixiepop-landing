## Limitation

Currently PixiePop uses a free version of Stable Diffusion API which runs out of credits pretty easily. I try to keep up and manually add a different account once the current account reaches it limit, so if you encounter an issue while generating your images please react out to me(open a issue here) so I can update the credentials in the backend :)
